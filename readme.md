HexBase is a stripped-down, light-weight, header-only library, providing a framework for applications following the Ports and Adapters design philosophy for agile software development.
The difference between HexBase and other Implementations of Hexagonal software architecture is the replacement of domains with modules.

HexBase is written in C++ and comes with tests.
